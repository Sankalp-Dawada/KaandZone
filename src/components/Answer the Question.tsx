    <h1>Answer the Question</h1>
    <p><strong>Answer the Question</strong> is a thrilling social deduction game where players test their observation and reasoning skills to uncover the imposters hiding among them. Each round challenges players to answer a seemingly identical question — but beware, one or two players receive a slightly different prompt. Can you spot who’s bluffing?</p>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>At the start of each round, all players are shown a question — except for 1 or 2 secret imposters who receive a slightly different version of the question.</li>
        <li>Players take turns answering their question aloud. Try to answer naturally and convincingly — whether you're a regular player or an imposter.</li>
        <li>After everyone has answered, players discuss and try to identify who received the different question — in other words, who the imposters are.</li>
        <li>At the end of the round, everyone votes on who they think the imposter(s) is/are.</li>
        <li>Reveal the imposters and see who guessed correctly! Then start a new round with fresh questions and new imposters.</li>
    </ol>    
    <p>This game is perfect for parties, team bonding, or online hangouts. It promotes fun, creativity, and quick thinking. Will you blend in or be found out?</p>
