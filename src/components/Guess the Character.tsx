    <h1>Guess the Character</h1>
    <p><strong>Guess the Character</strong> is a fun and engaging deduction game where each player is assigned a secret character that everyone else can see â€” except them! By asking clever questions, players try to figure out who their hidden character is.</p>

    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Each player is assigned a character, which is visible to all other players but hidden from themselves.</li>
        <li>Players take turns asking yes/no questions to gather clues about their character's traits, appearance, or background. (e.g., "Am I from a cartoon?", "Do I wear a hat?", "Am I a villain?")</li>
        <li>Other players answer honestly based on the character they see.</li>
        <li>Based on the answers, each player tries to deduce their character's identity.</li>
        <li>When a player thinks they know who they are, they can make a guess. If correct, they win the round. If not, they must wait until their next turn to guess again.</li>
        <li>The game continues until all players have correctly guessed their characters or a set number of rounds is completed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This game is great for groups, both in-person and online. It sparks creativity, encourages interaction, and keeps everyone guessing!</p>
